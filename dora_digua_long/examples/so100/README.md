# Dora pipeline for teleoperated low-cost arm and episode recording for LeRobot

SO-ARM100 is a low-cost robotic arm that can be teleoperated using a similar arm. This repository contains
the Dora pipeline to record episodes for LeRobot.

## Assembling

Check the [ASSEMBLING.md](ASSEMBLING.md) file for instructions on how to assemble the robot from scratch.

## Installations

Check the [INSTALLATIONS.md](INSTALLATION.md) file for instructions on how to install the required software and
environment
to run the robot.

## Configuring

Check the [CONFIGURING.md](CONFIGURING.md) file for instructions on how to configure the robot to record episodes for
LeRobot and teleoperate the robot.

## Recording

It's probably better to check the [examples](#examples) below before trying to record episodes. It will give you a
better
understanding of how Dora works.

Check the [RECORDING.md](RECORDING.md) file for instructions on how to record episodes for LeRobot.

## Examples

There are also some other example applications in the `graphs` folder. Have fun!

Here is a list of the available examples:

Here is a list of the available examples:

- `mono_teleop_real_with_alexk_lcr.yml`: A simple real teleoperation pipeline that allows you to control a follower arm
  using a leader
  arm. It
  does not record the episodes, so you don't need to have a camera.

You must configure the arms, retrieve the device port, and modify the file `mono_teleop_real_with_alexk_lcr.yml` to set
the correct
environment variables. (e.g. `PORT` and `CONFIG`, `LEADER_CONTROL` and `FOLLOWER_CONTROL`)

```bash
cd dora/

# If you are using a custom environment, you will have to activate it before running the command
source [your_custom_env_bin]/activate

# If you followed the installation instructions, you can run the following command
source venv/bin/activate # On Linux
source venv/Scripts/activate # On Windows bash
venv\Scripts\activate.bat # On Windows cmd
venv\Scripts\activate.ps1 # On Windows PowerShell

dora build ./examples/so100/graphs/mono_teleop_real_with_alexk_lcr.yml # Only the first time, it will install all the requirements if needed

dora up
dora start ./examples/so100/graphs/mono_teleop_real_with_alexk_lcr.yml
```
